# Resume Template

This is an A4-sized single-columned curriculum vitae/résumé using base LaTeX fonts with added packages (fontawesome for contact information icons). The set sections were custom-tailored for my own résumé, so I think it may differ according to the industries and specialties you seek to use this template for.

### Preview

The five sections included in this template are education, work experience, awards & scholarships, linguistic skills, and technical skills. There are options for subsections with different number of fields such as in education (see preview below).
